<p>Welcome to the GitHub page for my Reddit bot! I'm excited to share this project with you.</p>
<p>My Reddit bot is written in Python and uses the <a href="https://github.com/mmabrouk/chatgpt-wrapper">ChatGPT-Wrapper</a> repository by mmabrouk to generate answers to Reddit threads and submissions. I designed it to provide helpful and engaging responses to users on Reddit, making it a valuable addition to any subreddit.</p>
<p>The bot allows the developer to have control over various features, such as filters for inappropriate language, multiple personalities for the bot to use when generating responses, customizable delays between responses, and the ability to specify which subreddit(s) the bot should operate in. This makes the bot highly customizable and easy to tailor to your specific needs.</p>
<p>To use the bot, you will need to host it on your own local machine or server. Once it is set up, the bot will scan the subreddit(s) of your choice for new threads and submissions. When it finds an unanswered thread or submission, it will use the ChatGPT large language model to generate a response and post it as a comment on the Reddit thread. This allows the bot to provide helpful and engaging responses to users on Reddit, making it a valuable addition to any subreddit.</p>
<p>I'm the sole developer of this Reddit bot, and I put a lot of time and effort into making it as helpful and engaging as possible. If you have any feedback or suggestions for improvements, I would love to hear them. Thank you for visiting my GitHub page and considering my project!</p>
